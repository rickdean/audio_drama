# The Audio Drama Show Entry App for Producers

Welcome to the Audio Drama Show Entry App designed specifically for audio drama producers.
There are many times when an audio producer needs to send out links quickly (i.e. during
interviews, listener queries, marketing) and this app serves as a quick means for
accessing and distributing this information.

## User Stories

Prior to development I outlined some user stories from an audio producer's
perspective.  In order to be an asset the following stories were considered:

- A Producer would need to protect their data (i.e. login authoization)
- A Producer would need a simple interface to access their show 'cards'
- A Producer would need to have the ability to create show 'cards'
- A Producer would need to ability to edit the data on the show 'cards'
- A Producer would need the ability to view all cards at once
- A Producer would need the ability to delete show 'cards'
- A Producer would need the ability to navigate the application in an intuitive,
interface led, way

development process.
